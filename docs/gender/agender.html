<p>as of this writing, I discovered that I am genderless less than a week ago. some small part of me is still doubting and makes me hedge my words when I say that I am, but in truth I think I’ve known for a long time.</p>
<p>I remember thinking for years that I didn’t really have a sense of “being male” like people apparently do. when coming out to myself as agender, I remember saying “I wish I could opt out of gender,” but thinking I somehow couldn’t, and it was agonizing. I spent ages racking my brain for some repressed traces of trans desire or some hidden understanding of my “true” nonbinary gender, but I completely missed the obvious desire right in front of me – the desire to be free from gender altogether.</p>
<p>for me, being agender is the opposite of <a href="./how-it-feels.html">feeling confined</a>. put simply, it is the freedom to look in the mirror and see only myself, free from the judgement and <a href="./obligation.html">obligation</a> of gender. seeing myself as genderless and accepting it feels like a weight off of my shoulders.</p>
