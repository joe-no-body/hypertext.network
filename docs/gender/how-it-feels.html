<p>I’ve described gender as an <a href="./obligation.html">obligation</a>, but I haven’t really captured how it feels.</p>
<p>When I imagine gender in my head, I see it first as a lens. I picture my observing self as a small, confined entity, almost like the sensor in a camera body, and from this perspective, gender is a lens that completely controls the observing mind’s view. Every thought, every action, the way I look, the way I feel – all of it refracts through this lens, and it feels wrong. Distorted, manipulated, focusing on the wrong things and obscuring the right things. I can see the things I want, but they seem so far away and unreachable, so impossible they may as well be a tree on a mountain hundreds of miles away. In this view, no matter how far I walk, I can never get there. Or they seem repulsive, undesirable, something I shouldn’t want. Both unattainable and undesirable.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I see it as a thick, scratchy blanket, so heavy it seems to crush me, or a tight clamshell case snapped around my brain, crushing it.</p>
<p>There’s another view. I see the expression of gender as an immense, infinitely-dimensional space of possibilities. We can imagine gender roles and obligations as a dense web of constraints, an infinitely complex set of rules dictating which ranges of values these dimensions are masculine and feminine, and which values an associated individual must have to be considered as male or female. In my mind I see dense clouds or clusters or nebulas or galaxies of tiny dots on these axes – the people who exist there. There are two massive clusters – not points but clusters – with dense cores and then sparse tendrils drifting out in all directions. The cluster I call “male” is a soft yellow or orange, and I find myself feeling very far from it, even as its immense size looms before me. And yet, along many axes, I am close to it. There are parts of it I occupy that I find desirable, even as I hate the thought of being stuck there. Somewhere else, there is a cluster I might call “female” and yet it is a space I don’t seem to see in this imagined perspective. Perhaps it is the other side of the cluster I see or perhaps there is no other cluster, but this is all I can observe where I’m at now.</p>
