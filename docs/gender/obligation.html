<p>For years, I have grappled with the question of what it means to be male. Despite presenting as male and identifying as male (or male adjacent), I always struggled to define what it meant to be a man. I searched inside myself for an answer, trying to feel that inner sense of gender I’d heard about over and over, but I never could. It escaped me. For a long time, I thought this was a sign of repression, of self-ignorance and lack of self-understanding. I always told myself there must be something I was missing, some missing understanding that would crack my egg open and reveal my true self. I never considered that the absence of this sense was in fact the very feeling I was looking for.</p>
<p>Until I did, and then it all made sense.</p>
<p>Now, seeing myself as genderless, I’ve realized that I can define maleness quite easily: it is an obligation.</p>
<p>As I see it, to be a man is to be obligated to look and act in particular ways. To identify as male is to accept a social contract that says I must uphold these obligations in exchange for the privileges of maleness. Under these terms, a man must embrace masculinity, rejecting feminine or un-manly actions. A man is judged by his conformance with the obligations of his gender. He must accept the judgement of those around him if he does not comply or he must reject this judgement and assert his own maleness in contradiction to the obligations that society expects. If a man wishes to conform, he must constantly view and evaluate himself through the lens of acceptable masculinity to ensure he is upholding his obligations, sacrificing anything that they do not permit. Thus, whether I conform or not, to be a man is to define myself in terms of these obligations and my conformance to or rejection thereof.</p>
<p>I do not accept these terms and conditions.</p>
<p>I’ve asked myself if perhaps I’m simply a non-conforming man, a man who doesn’t want to be bound by the terms of maleness, but this doesn’t speak to me. Even as a man defying the obligations of maleness, I feel that I must assert something that does not exist. There is no voice in my soul that cries, “I am a man!” when I say that I am not. There is no joy in seeing myself, my experience, in terms of manhood. There is only the suffocation that I feel when I am told (or when I tell myself) that I am.</p>
<p>I simply can’t abide the torment of framing myself in the lens of maleness.</p>
