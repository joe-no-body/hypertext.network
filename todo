- save CNAME when remaking docs/
- table of contents per directory
- tags/topics/categories or something
- list backlinks ("what links here") on each page
- top level site statistics - word count and whatnot
- factor out site generation code to a separate project so I'm not tracking both
  content and content generation in one place
