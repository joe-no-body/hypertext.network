something I'm also noticing is a trace of doubt that I'm somehow not agender enough to really be agender, particularly when it comes to being gay

I've been out to myself as gay since I was a teenager and out to basically everyone after that, but it's sorta tricky to identify as being attracted to the same gender when I have none. I feel a slight need to define things more precisely

in general, I'm attracted to a lot of fairly "conventionally masculine" men, although I take a much broader view of conventional masculinity than I'd guess a lot of people do. I'd sorta like to find a better label than "men" here but there's a certain precision to it that's hard to capture otherwise. maybe this will change but I haven't historically found myself being attracted to women, even if they're butch

what's weird to me is there's this space of maleness and male adjacency that I've lived in and found constraining when viewed as male, but yet is exactly what I'm attracted to and enjoy seeing myself as. I just don't like to label myself as male

part of me wants to say that this means I'm faking or making too big of a deal out of being genderless. after all, it says, if I look and act like a man anyway, then what's the big deal?

of course, this immediately makes me feel the weight of maleness again, and that I do not want

thus far, the most effective compromise I've come to is that I consider myself gay because I am attracted to people whose gender expression resembles my own.
