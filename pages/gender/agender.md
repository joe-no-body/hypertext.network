as of this writing, I discovered that I am genderless less than a week ago. some
small part of me is still doubting and makes me hedge my words when I say that I
am, but in truth I think I've known for a long time.

I remember thinking for years that I didn't really have a sense of "being male"
like people apparently do. when coming out to myself as agender, I remember
saying "I wish I could opt out of gender," but thinking I somehow couldn't, and
it was agonizing. I spent ages racking my brain for some repressed traces of
trans desire or some hidden understanding of my "true" nonbinary gender, but I
completely missed the obvious desire right in front of me -- the desire to be
free from gender altogether.

for me, being agender is the opposite of [feeling confined](./how-it-feels.md).
put simply, it is the freedom to look in the mirror and see only myself, free
from the judgement and [obligation](./obligation.md) of gender. seeing myself as
genderless and accepting it feels like a weight off of my shoulders.
