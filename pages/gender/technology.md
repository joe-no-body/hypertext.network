imagining the social construct of gender as a technology -- a tool for stratifying and organizing society around reproduction and male domination.

it's hard for me not to consider gender as essentially a tool for organizing patriarchy around the need of heterosexual men to decide who they can fuck and reproduce with. it constructs definitions of "men" and "women" which define who fucks and who is fucked, excluding entirely those who are insufficiently male or female and thus "unfit" to participate in a normative mode of reproduction. the enforcement of gender roles thus becomes a means to ensure that each pool is "clean", free of those who would subvert this order of reproductive domination.
