masculine is how you feel, not what you do. you can be masculine in high heels, a dress, and makeup, just as you can be in a suit and tie or a hoodie and sweatpants or bare naked. it is a valence of being that beats in your heart and your expression no matter how you appear.

I've found it hard to articulate is the separation of masculinity from maleness. when I think of masculinity, I obviously think first of men, but it feels wrong to define it in a way that excludes people like myself, or anyone who feels connected to it. to do so would seem to concede the entire concept to toxic masculinity and the men who cultivate it to the exclusion of anyone they deem unfit.

masculinity -- its conception and reality -- has been dominated by men, but I think it's wrong to cede it to maleness. masculinity is not simply what men do, it is what men have done, and for those who have escaped gender, there is no reason we can't seize it for ourselves.

"masculinity" is the label we have been given for this territory, and perhaps the first mistake is to concede it, but I also can't help but feel that appropriating it and opening it up is a means to split open maleness itself


if gender is a [technology](/gender/technology.md) used to order society around male domination, then genderless masculinity is masculinity hollowed out, its domineering core excised and disposed of. however, this does not make for a crumbling facade. genderless masculinity is hollow, but it is not empty nor useless. it is the leather of maleness, the hide of the beast laid open, able to be reworked and remade anew.
